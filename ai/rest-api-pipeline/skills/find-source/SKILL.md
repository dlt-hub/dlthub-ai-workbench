# Find a dlt source

Locate the best dlt source for what the user wants to extract data from.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `source-name` (required): what the user wants to extract data from (e.g., "alpaca markets", "stripe", "postgres", "csv files", "rest api")

## Goal
Do the research on available data source options and let the user to make informed decision what you will build. This is the moment you gather
requirements from the user, learn about goals and intended data usage. You build context for other tasks. At the end you provide clear instructions
how to start creating pipeline.

## Steps

### 1. Classify the request

| User says (examples) | Core source |
|---|---|
| postgres, mysql, mssql, oracle, database, db, sql | `sql_database` |
| rest api, http api, web api, rest | `rest_api` |
| files, csv, parquet, jsonl, s3, gcs, azure blob, local files | `filesystem` |

If it matches a core source, skip to **step 4** and report the core source match.

### 2. Search verified sources

If the request looks like a specific API/service name, run:
```
dlt init --list-sources
```
Search the output (case-insensitive) for the source name. If found, report the match and the `dlt init <source> <destination>` command. Done.

### 3. Search dlthub context

If not found in verified sources, use web search:
```
query: dlthub.com source <source-name>
```

Look for results matching `dlthub.com/workspace/source/<slug>` or `dlthub.com/context/source/<slug>`.

If a match is found, fetch the page to extract the exact `dlt init dlthub:<source_identifier> <destination>` command:
```
WebFetch: https://dlthub.com/workspace/source/<slug>
```

### 4. Validate the match

Before reporting, verify the source actually covers what the user needs.

**If a dlthub source was found (step 2 or 3):** briefly describe to the user what endpoints/resources the source provides so they can confirm it's what they want. Do NOT run `dlt init` yet — wait for user confirmation.

```
Source found: <source-name>
  Init command: dlt init dlthub:<source_identifier> duckdb
  Resources: <short list of endpoints/resources the source covers>
  Page: <url>

Does this match what you need?
```

**If the request maps to a core source (step 1):** report it directly — no confirmation needed.
```
Core source: <source_type>
  rest_api: declarative REST API connector with auth, pagination, and incremental loading
  sql_database: extracts tables from SQL databases (Postgres, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, etc.)
  filesystem: reads files (CSV, Parquet, JSONL) from local disk or cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure)
```

For sql_database and filesystem

### 5. Web search fallback

If no match was found, or the match doesn't cover what the user actually needs — do a short web search to find the **primary API or data source** the user should be using:

```
query: <source-name> API documentation
```

Based on the search results, determine if a **core source type** fits as a fallback:

| Data source is... | Core source | Init command |
|---|---|---|
| A REST/HTTP API | `rest_api` | `dlt init rest_api duckdb` |
| A SQL database | `sql_database` | `dlt init sql_database duckdb` |
| Files (local/cloud) | `filesystem` | `dlt init filesystem duckdb` |

Prefer falling back to a core source when possible — it gives a proper template with full configuration examples (e.g., `RESTAPIConfig` with auth, pagination, incremental loading). Using an unknown source name with `dlt init <name> duckdb` gives a generic intro template that is much less useful.

Report to the user:
- What the actual API/service is (name, docs URL)
- Which core source type fits and why (or `dlt init <source-name> duckdb` if nothing fits)
- The `dlt init` command to run
