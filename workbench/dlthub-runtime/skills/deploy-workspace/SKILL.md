# Deploy to dltHub Runtime

Assumes (`setup-runtime`) and (`prepare-deployment`) have been completed — workspace is set up, credentials are configured, and runtime login is done.

## Step 1: Prepare scripts for production

Review each script being deployed and fix patterns that are safe locally but harmful in production:

1. **Remove `dev_mode=True`** from `dlt.pipeline()` calls — it drops and recreates the dataset on every run, destroying production data.
2. **Remove or externalize dev limits** — `limit=N` parameters, `.add_limit(N)` calls, or hardcoded date ranges meant for testing. Either remove them or make them configurable (e.g. via `dlt.config.value`).
3. **Verify `write_disposition`** — `"replace"` is fine for full-refresh pipelines, but confirm the user doesn't actually want `"merge"` or `"append"` for incremental loads.
4. **Check `if __name__ == "__main__":` block** — every script must have one or the runtime job does nothing. The block should NOT contain interactive/debug-only code.
5. **Pin the dlt version exactly** in `pyproject.toml` — use `==` not `>=` to prevent unexpected upgrades on runtime. If user has a pre-release (e.g. `1.23.0a1`), use `uv pip install` to install it and pin with `==` in pyproject (do NOT use `uv add` which may downgrade to latest stable).
6. **Notebooks (`marimo` apps)**:
   - Verify they use `dlt.attach()` (not `dlt.pipeline()`) and that **destination** and **dataset_name** are explicitly passed (this is a temporary limitation of the runtime)
   - All visualization dependencies (`altair`, `ibis-framework`, `pandas`, etc.) are in `pyproject.toml`

## Step 2: Deploy, launch, debug

**Reference**: https://dlthub.com/docs/hub/runtime/overview.md

```bash
dlt runtime deploy                             # sync code + config
dlt runtime launch my_pipeline.py              # run batch job once (ie pipeline)
dlt runtime serve my_notebook.py              # run interactive job (ie. notebook)
dlt runtime logs my_pipeline.py                # check output
```


After deploying:
- Check the first run completes successfully with `dlt runtime logs`
- If it fails, use (`debug-deployment`) to diagnose


NOTE: do not put any pipelines on schedule. This part is coming soon

## Important

- Scripts must have `if __name__ == "__main__":` or the job does nothing.
- Runtime installs from `pyproject.toml` — add all needed packages (e.g. `uv add numpy pandas` if using `.df()`).
- Jobs are killed after 120 minutes. Use incremental loads for long pipelines.
- One workspace per GitHub account — connecting a new repo replaces existing deployments.
